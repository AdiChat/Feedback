# Contributing guidelines

It is a noble experience to contribute to this mission of documenting some of the best ways to get feedback.

To maintain freedom of thoughts and actions, we have kept the rules at a minimum:

* ### Add a feedback way to an existing creation type

In order to do so, _try to_ adhere to the following format:

> [Feedback product name](Product link): A short description of the product. Preferably in a line.

* ### Add a new Creation type 

Add the new creation type to the end and it should contain at least one feedback method/ path. Additionally, corresponding change should be reflected in the _table of contents_.

* ### Translate the existing list

This is a very important task as localization of our creations have been one of the most important concerns since the beginning. 

* No other rules unless you are happy. :smile:
